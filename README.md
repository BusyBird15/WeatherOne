**WeatherOne:** Simple and quick weather app for the Gabb Phone Z2 and Gabb Phone Plus.
Built with MIT App Inventor, I just added the "images" and "releases" folders, extracted the apk code, and uploaded it to Github.

<br>

## Features:
* **Custom-named favorites:** Name favorite locations instead of the location name.
* **Live data via NOAA:** Featuring NOAA's free api, the app has hyper-local and hyper-live data for anywhere in the U.S.
* **7-day forecast:** Complete 7-day forecast includes the condition, high temp, and low temp for one week in advance.
* **Doppler radar:** A live radar for the queried location is fetched and displayed as a gif file.
* **Beautiful graphics:** Ultra-high resolution graphics all designed by me.
* **Blocks cell data:** The app will not work unless it recieves wi-fi. Cell data is not used.

<br>

## Known bugs:
* Fetching data from outside the US returns an error "the select list item cannot accept the following arguments". Tap around it or press the back button to ignore.

<br>

## Next release:
* *Will* fix known bugs.
* *May* provide alerts for the queried location.
* *May* send a notification for alerts for the user's area.
