# WeatherOne

Simple and quick weather app for Android devices.

Built for the Gabb Phone Z2 and Gabb Phone Plus.

This app comes pre-featured with the ability to block fetching data if the user is using cell data and no wi-fi.

Built with MIT App Inventor, and building the source code may not work because I added the "images" and "releases" folders.
